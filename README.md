- 👋 Hi, I’m @grahamstepan22
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how things work and why they work.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning just how to code. I just started and haven't really started yet.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... Not sure, I just started so maybe nothing or only a few small projects at the start and then expanding as I learn more.
- 📫 How to reach me you can reach me at grahamstepan22@gmail.com. Thanks!
